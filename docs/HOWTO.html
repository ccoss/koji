    <title>Koji HOWTO</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    Koji is a system for building and tracking RPMs. It was designed with the following
    features in mind:

    <p>
    <b>Security</b>
    <ul>
      <li>New buildroot for each build</li>
      <li>nfs is used (mostly) read-only</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Leverage other software</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses Yum and Mock open-source components</li>
      <li>XML-RPC APIs for easy integration with other tools</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Flexibility</b>
    <ul>
      <li>rich data model</li>
      <li>active code base</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Usability</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Web interface with Kerberos authentication</li>
      <li>Thin, portable client</li>
      <li>Users can create local buildroots</li>
    </ul>

    <b>Reproducibility</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Buildroot contents are tracked in the database</li>
      <li>Versioned data</li>
    </ul>


    <p> This HOWTO document covers the basic tasks that a developer needs to be
    able to accomplish with Koji.
    </p>

    <h1>Getting started</h1>

    <h2>The web interface</h2>
    <p>The primary interface for viewing Koji data is a web application. Most of the interface
    is read-only, but if you are logged in (see below) and have sufficient privileges there
    are some actions that can be performed though the web. For example:
    <ul>
    <li>Cancel a build</li>
    <li>Resubmit a failed task</li>
    </ul>
    Those with admin privileges will find additional actions, such as:
    <ul>
    <li>Create/Edit/Delete a tag</li>
    <li>Create/Edit/Delete a target</li>
    <li>Enable/Disable a build host</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The web site utilizes Kerberos authentication. In order to log in you will
    need a valid Kerberos ticket and your web browser will need to be configured to send the
    Kerberos information to the server.

    <p>In Firefox or Mozilla, you will need to use the about:config page to set a few parameters.
    Use the search term 'negotiate' to filter the list. Change
    network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris to the domain you want to authenticate against,
    e.g .example.com. You can leave network.negotiate-auth.delegation-uris blank, as it
    enables Kerberos ticket passing, which is not required. If you do not see those two
    config options listed, your version of Firefox or Mozilla may be too old to support
    Negotiate authentication, and you should consider upgrading.

    <p>In order to obtain a Kerberos ticket, use the kinit command.


    <h2>Installing the Koji cli</h2>
    <p>There is a single point of entry for most operations.  The command is
    called 'koji' and is included in the main koji package.

    <p>Repos/webpage TBD

    <p>
    The koji tool authenticates to the central server using Kerberos, so you will need
    to have a valid Kerberos ticket to use many features. However, many of the read-only
    commands will work without authentication.

    <h2>Building a package</h2>
    <p>Builds are initiated with the command line tool.
    To build a package, the syntax is:</p>
    <pre>$ koji build &lt;build target&gt; &lt;cvs URL&gt;</pre>

    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre>$ koji build dist-fc7-scratch 'cvs://cvs.example.com/cvs/dist?rpms/kernel/FC-7#kernel-2_6_20-1_2925_fc7'</pre>
    <p>
    The <code>koji build</code> command creates a build task in Koji. By default
    the tool will wait
    and print status updates until the build completes. You can override this with
    the <code>--nowait</code> option. To view other options to the build command use the
    <code>--help</code> option.
    </p>

    <pre>$ koji build --help
</pre>

    <h2>Build Options</h2>
    <p>
    There are a few options to the build command. Here are some more detailed explanations
    of them:
    </p>

    <dl>
    <dt>--skip-tag</dt>
    <dd>Normally the package is tagged after the build completes. This option causes
    the tagging step to be skipped. The package will be in the system, but untagged
    (you can later tag it with the tag-pkg command)</dd>
    <dt>--scratch</dt>
    <dd>This makes the build into a scratch build. The build will not be
    imported into the db, it will just be built. The rpms will land under
    &lt;topdir&gt;/scratch.  Scratch builds are not tracked and can never
    be tagged, but can be convenient for testing. Scratch builds are
    typically removed from the filesystem after one week.
    </dd>
    <dt>--nowait</dt>
    <dd>As stated above, this prevents the cli from waiting on the build task.</dd>
    <dt>--arch-override</dt>
    <dd>This option allows you to override the base set of arches to build for.
    This option is really only for testing during the beta period, but it may
    be retained for scratch builds in the future.</dd>
    </dl>

    <h2>Build Failures</h2>
    <p>If your package fails to build, you will see something like this.</p>
    <pre>
      420066 buildArch (kernel-2.6.18-1.2739.10.9.el5.jjf.215394.2.src.rpm,
      ia64): open (build-1.example.com) -> FAILED: BuildrootError:
      error building package (arch ia64), mock exited with status 10
    </pre>

    <p>You can figure out why the build failed by looking at the log files. If
    there is a build.log, start there.  Otherwise, look at init.log</p>

    <pre>
      $ ls -1 &lt;topdir&gt;/work/tasks/420066/*
      &lt;topdir&gt;/work/tasks/420066/build.log
      &lt;topdir&gt;/work/tasks/420066/init.log
      &lt;topdir&gt;/work/tasks/420066/mockconfig.log
      &lt;topdir&gt;/work/tasks/420066/root.log
    </pre>

    <h1>Koji Architecture</h1>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    In Koji, it is sometimes necessary to distinguish between the a package in general,
    a specific build of a package, and the various rpm files created by a build. When
    precision is needed, these terms should be interpreted as follows:

    <dl>
    <dt>Package</dt>
    <dd>The name of a source rpm. This refers to the package in general and not
    any particular build or subpackage. For example: kernel, glibc, etc.</dd>
    <dt>Build</dt>
    <dd>A particular build of a package. This refers to the entire build: all arches
    and subpackages. For example: kernel-2.6.9-34.EL, glibc-2.3.4-2.19.</dd>
    <dt>RPM</dt>
    <dd>A particular rpm. A specific arch and subpackage of a build.
    For example: kernel-2.6.9-34.EL.x86_64, kernel-devel-2.6.9-34.EL.s390,
    glibc-2.3.4-2.19.i686, glibc-common-2.3.4-2.19.ia64</dd>
    </dl>


    <h2>Koji Components</h2>

    Koji is comprised of several components:

    <ul>
    <li><em>koji-hub</em> is the center of all Koji operations.  It is an XML-RPC server
    running under mod_python in Apache.  koji-hub is passive in that it only
    receives XML-RPC calls and relies upon the build daemons and other
    components to initiate communication.  koji-hub is the only component that
    has direct access to the database and is one of the two components that have
    write access to the file system.</li>

    <li><em>kojid</em> is the build daemon that runs on each of the build machines.  Its
    primary responsibility is polling for incoming build requests and handling
    them accordingly.  Koji also has support for tasks other than building.
    Creating install images is one example.  kojid is responsible for handling
    these tasks as well.

    <p>kojid uses mock for building.  It also creates a fresh buildroot for
    every build.  kojid is written in Python and communicates with koji-hub via
    XML-RPC.</p></li>

    <li><em>koji-web</em> is a set of scripts that run in mod_python and use the Cheetah
    templating engine to provide an web interface to Koji.  koji-web exposes a
    lot of information and also provides a means for certain operations, such as
    cancelling builds.</li>

    <li><em>koji</em> is a CLI written in Python that provides many hooks into
    Koji.  It allows the user to query much of the data as well as perform
    actions such as build initiation.</li>

    <li><em>kojirepod</em> is a daemon that keeps the build root repodata
    updated.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Package Organization</h2>
    <p><i>Tags and Targets</i></p>
    <p>Koji organizes packages using tags. In Koji a tag is roughly analogous to
    a beehive collection instance, but differ in a number of ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tags are tracked in the database but not on disk</li>
        <li>Tags support multiple inheritance</li>
        <li>Each tag has its own list of valid packages (inheritable)</li>
        <li>Package ownership can be set per-tag (inheritable)</li>
        <li>Tag inheritance is more configurable</li>
        <li>When you build you specify a <i>target</i> rather than a tag</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    A build target specifies where a package should be built and how it
    should be tagged afterwards. This allows target names to remain fixed
    as tags change through releases. You can get a full list of build targets
    with the following command:</p>
    <pre>$ koji list-targets
</pre>
    You can see just a single target with the <code>--name</code> option:
    <pre>$ koji list-targets --name dist-fc7
Name                           Buildroot                      Destination
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
dist-fc7                       dist-fc7-build                 dist-fc7
</pre>
    This tells you a build for target dist-fc7 will use a buildroot with packages
    from the tag dist-fc7-build and tag the resulting packages as dist-fc7.
    <p>
    You can get a list of tags with the following command:</p>
    <pre>$ koji list-tags
</pre>
    <p><i>Package lists</i></p>
    <p>
    As mentioned above, each tag has its own list of packages that may be placed
    in the tag. To see that list for a tag, use the <code>list-pkgs</code> command:</p>
    <pre>$ koji list-pkgs --tag dist-fc7
Package                 Tag                     Extra Arches     Owner

...
</pre>
    The first column is the name of the package, the second tells you which tag
    the package entry has been inherited from, and the third tells you the owner
    of the package.
    <p><i>Latest Builds</i></p>
    <p>
    To see the latest builds for a tag, use the <code>latest-pkg</code> command:</p>
    <pre>$ koji latest-pkg --all dist-fc7
Build                                     Tag                   Built by
----------------------------------------  --------------------  ----------------

</pre>
    The output gives you not only the latest builds, but which tag they have
    been inherited from and who built them (note: for builds imported from beehive
    the "built by" field may be misleading)


    <h2>Exploring Koji</h2>

    <p>We've tried to make Koji self-documenting wherever possible. The command
    line tool will print a list of valid commands and each command supports
    <code>--help</code>. For example:</p>

    <pre>
$ koji help
Koji commands are:
        build                Build a package from source
        cancel-task          Cancel a task
        help                 List available commands
        latest-build         Print the latest rpms for a tag
        latest-pkg           Print the latest builds for a tag
...
$ koji build --help
usage: koji build [options] tag URL
(Specify the --help global option for a list of other help options)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --skip-tag            Do not attempt to tag package
  --scratch             Perform a scratch build
  --nowait              Don't wait on build
...
</pre>
